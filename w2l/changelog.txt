Changelog for Writer2LaTeX version 1.4 -> 1.6.1

---------- version 1.6.1 final ----------

[w2x] Bugfix: Fixed problem with bibliography, which was missing in export (regression in 1.6.1 beta)

[w2x] Bugfix: Do not export writing direction on headings and paragraphs if multilingual is false

---------- version 1.6.1 beta ----------

[w2l] Bugfix: String replace now works consistently again (backported from v2.0)

[w2x] Bugfix: Fixed crash in EPUB export caused by some paragraphs with an image as only content

[w2x] Bugfix: The alphabetical index can now be placed anywhere in the document (backported from v2.0)

[w2x] New EPUB compatibility option avoid_html5, which turns of the use of HTML5-specific tags in EPUB 3

[w2x] The EPUB option external_toc_depth can now have the value 0 (do not include any headings)

[w2x] New EPUB option external_toc_depth_marks to include toc-marks in the external table of contents

[w2x] New EPUB option index_links to include links to alphabetical index and user index in the external
  table of contents

[w2x] Added support for keys in alphabetical index (backported from v2.0)

[w2x] Added support for user index (index marks only) (backported from v2.0)

---------- version 1.6 final ----------

[w2x] Updated URL to MathJax

[w2x] Add StarMath annotation as alttext attribute on formulas (according to the EPUB 3 specification, math
  elements should have the either the alttext attribute or annotation-xml)

[w2x] Changed file extension for HTML5 files from .html to .xhtml in EPUB 3 export (not required, but EpubCheck
  issues a warning otherwise)

---------- version 1.6 beta ----------

[w2l] Removed remark about JabRef plugin for LO from help file, as the functionality is now native in JabRef 

[w2l] Enabled export of WMF and EMF graphics to PDF (was disabled due to bugs in earlier versions of LO)

[w2x] In the BibTeX dialog, updating references generates a status message. This is now moved from a message box
  to in a label at the bottom of the dialog.

[w2x] No longer add cellspacing attribute if exporting to HTML5

[w2l] Added support for non-ASCII BibTeX files. The new option bibtex_encoding is used to specify the encoding of
  the BibTeX files loaded via the option external_bibtex_files. The default value is "document" which implies the
  same encoding as the LaTeX document. Otherwise the same values as for inputencoding are supported.
  In the UI, the encoding can be selected on the bibliography page of the toolbar settings.
  The setting is ignored if the backend is XeTeX, in this case all files are assumed to be UTF-8.
  Also, the default bibtex application has been changed to bibtex8 (but currently no attempt is made to select the
  proper .csf file)

[w2l] The command \textsubscript is now defined with \providecommand to avoid problems with other packages that may
  already have defined this command

[w2l] Added basic support for hebrew (XeTeX backend only). If the default CTL language is hebrew the entire document
  is exported with hebrew language setting with a suitable default font (Frank Ruehl CLM/Nachlieli CLM/Miriam Mono CLM)

[w2x] In EPUB the title must be non-empty. To avoid creating an invalid EPUB, the file name is now used as title
  if the title is empty.

[w2l] Removed old experimental option use_oooref

[w2x] Bugfix: writer2latex.xhtml.TableConverter.borderWidth ran into an infinite loop if border shorthand properties
  didn't begin with width, but e.g. with colour (e.g. "#000000 0.035cm solid").  
  See bug tracker #4 fix for infinite loop in writer2latex.xhtml.TableConverter.borderWidth

[w2l] If use_bibtex is false, the bibliography is now exported using a thebibliography environment rather than as
  plain text

[w2x] The bibliography is now regenerated from the template. This implies that bibliographic citations now link
  directly to the cited work rather than to the bibliography as a whole.

[w2x] The option separate_stylesheet can now be set in the configuration UI, on the Formatting page.

[w2x] New option max_width (default value 800px) used to define the max-width on the body element (XHTML and text
  documents only). In the custom configuration UI, this setting is found on the Formatting page.

[w2x] Added support for semantic inflection in EPUB 3 export for the types footnote(s), endnote(s), toc, index,
  bibliography and biblioentry
  (http://www.idpf.org/epub/30/spec/epub30-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-semantic-inflection).
  
[w2x] Improved the semantic markup of footnotes, endnotes, table of contents and alphabetical index in HTML export
  using sections, asides, headings and lists
  
[w2x] Added support for background color of alphabetical index and bibliography

[w2x] Bugfix: Export of list-style-type now uses the correct values disc, circle, square (in that order)

[w2l] UI strings in the code are now externalized for localization

[w2l] Color support in StarMath have changed with LO 4.4 and will with (probably) AOO 4.2
  (https://bz.apache.org/ooo/show_bug.cgi?id=118191). Now the 16 basic HTML colors are used. This is an incompatible
  change because StarMath used to apply dark versions of red, blue, cyan and magenta.
  The new colors are now supported, and a boolean option old_math_colors (default false) has been added to allow the
  user to apply the old colors. 

[w2l] In the Application dialog in the toolbar configuration it is now possible to select the systems's default
  application for the viewers. This is now the default, and in most cases this will imply that the toolbar works
  without configuration. The automatic configuration has been changed to use the default application if it fails
  to find the dedicated applications.

[w2l] The Application dialog in the toolbar configuration can now be used to select the behavior after export
  (do nothing, compile or (default) export, compile and preview)

---------- version 1.5.2 ----------

[all] Using the filters from the command line with soffice --headless --convert-to is now documented in the user manual

[all] Filter API change: The filters now accepts the FilterOptions property as an alternative to FilterData.
  This property accepts a comma separated string of option=value items. In particular this allows to pass option
  from the command line (soffice --headless --convert-to).

[all] API change: The interface OutputFile now defines an additional method containsMath() which returns true if the file
  contains mathematical formulas (only implemented for XHTML, currently always returns true for LaTeX)

[w2x] The template page in the configuration now displays an error message if the template is not well-formed XML.

[w2x] Added toolbar configuration dialog: Select XHTML and EPUB export format and behavior after export (do nothing,
  display in default viewer or display with custom application) 
  
[w2x] New option include_ncx to include a NCX file even if the export format is EPUB 3 

[w2x] Added EPUB 3 as export format and changed default export format for the toolbar to EPUB 3

[all] Implementation detail: Moved descriptions to a separate folder within the extensions

[all] The position of message boxes has changed from (0,0) to (200,100)

[w2l] Implementation detail: The dialog library W4LDialogs is now merged into W2LDialogs2. This avoids conflicts with
  the old Writer4LaTeX extension if this happens to be installed.

[all] Fixed typo in export dialogs: The text on the help button was in Danish.

[w2x] New boolean option embed_img (default false). If set to true, the binary contents of img elements are included
  directly on the src attribute as base64.
  
[w2l] The bibliography configuration is slightly modified: The options to convert Zotero or JabRef citations are now
  only available if the option to use external BibTeX files is selected 

[w2l] Added new BibTeX dialog to insert a bibliographic reference to a BibTeX file. The BibTeX files are located as
  defined in the configuration, and the reference is inserted as an ordinary reference mark.

[w2l] Various improvements to the log viewer dialog: Reduced height to better accommodate small screen resolutions.
  Added checkbox to filter the LaTeX log to display only errors. Added help page and long tips.

[w2x] Changed default export format for toolbar from XHTML+MathML to HTML5

[w2l] Added new option font to load font packages. It accepts a large number of standard font packages such as
  cmbright or fourier. Only packages with math support are included. Unknown packages defaults to Computer Modern.
  The font option is currently not available for the backend xetex.
  In the user interface, this option can be found in the export dialog. To make room for this, the BibTeX
  settings no longer has a heading in the dialog.

[w2l] Bugfix: Include w2lconfig.oxt in the distribution (was missing in 1.5.1)

---------- version 1.5.1 ----------

[w2l] Implementation detail: Updated to version 20140107 of the JSON library org.json.* from JSON.org.
  Now based on prebuilt jar rather than directly on the source.

[w2l] Merged the extension Writer4LaTeX into Writer2LaTeX, where it now appears as "the Writer2LaTeX toolbar".
  Replaced menu with a toolbar with four buttons: Insert BibTeX citation (not yet implemented), publish to LaTeX,
  view log files and edit custom format. (Publishing without showing the dialog is currently removed.)
  Using the toolbar bypasses the filter logic, which gives a significant performance gain for large documents.
  The remaining parts of Writer4LaTeX (the article template, configuration and help file) has been renamed
  to "Writer2LaTeX configurations" (short w2lconfig).

[all] Implementation detail: Replaced Robert Harder's base 64 class with javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter

[w2x] Style maps for paragraphs and headings now support the attributes before and after. These define fixed texts
  to add before/after the content. (This is similar to the pseudo-elements ::before and ::after in CSS.)

[w2x] Added toolbar with four buttons: Publish directly to XHTML, publish directly to EPUB, edit EPUB metadata
  and edit custom configuration. Publishing directly implies that the file picker is not displayed. Instead
  the document will be exported to the same directory as the currently open document and with the same name.
  The EPUB buttons are only visible in Writer, the other buttons are also visible in Calc.
  This feature bypasses the filter logic, which gives a significant performance gain for large documents.

[all] Filter: Refactored filter code, the actual conversion has been separated from the XExportFilter implementation
