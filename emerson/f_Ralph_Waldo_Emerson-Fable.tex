\begin{poem}
	\begin{stanza}
			The mountain and the squirrel\verseline
			Had a quarrel,\verseline
			And the former called the latter 'Little Prig;\verseline
			Bun replied,\verseline
			'You are doubtless very big;\verseline
			But all sorts of things and weather\verseline
			Must be taken in together,\verseline
			To make up a year\verseline
			And a sphere.\verseline
			And I think it no disgrace\verseline
			To occupy my place.\verseline
			If I'm not so large as you,\verseline
			You are not so small as I,\verseline
			And not half so spry.\verseline
			I'll not deny you make\verseline
			A very pretty squirrel track;\verseline
			Talents differ; all is well and wisely put;\verseline
			If I cannot carry forests on my back,\verseline
			Neither can you crack a nut.'
	\end{stanza}
