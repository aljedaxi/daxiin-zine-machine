\begin{poem}
	\begin{stanza}
			\emph{On being asked, Whence Is The Flower?}
	\end{stanza}
	\begin{stanza}
			In May, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes,\verseline
			I found the fresh Rhodora in the woods,\verseline
			Spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook,\verseline
			To please the desert and the sluggish brook.\verseline
			The purple petals, fallen in the pool,\verseline
			Made the black water with their beauty gay;\verseline
			Here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool,\verseline
			And court the flower that cheapens his array.\verseline
			Rhodora! if the sages ask thee why\verseline
			This charm is wasted on the earth and sky,\verseline
			Tell them, dear, that if eyes were made for seeing,\verseline
			Then Beauty is its own excuse for being:\verseline
			Why thou wert there, O rival of the rose!\verseline
			I never thought to ask, I never knew:\verseline
			But, in my simple ignorance, suppose\verseline
			The self-same Power that brought me here brought you.
