		\emph{On being asked, Whence Is The Flower?}\verseline
	\end{stanza}
	\begin{stanza}
		In May, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes,\verseline
		I found the fresh Rhodora in the woods,\verseline
		Spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook,\verseline
		To please the desert and the sluggish brook.\verseline
		The purple petals, fallen in the pool,\verseline
		Made the black water with their beauty gay;\verseline
		Here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool,\verseline
		And court the flower that cheapens his array.\verseline
		Rhodora! if the sages ask thee why\verseline
		This charm is wasted on the earth and sky,\verseline
		Tell them, dear, that if eyes were made for seeing,\verseline
		Then Beauty is its own excuse for being:\verseline
		Why thou wert there, O rival of the rose!\verseline
		I never thought to ask, I never knew:\verseline
		But, in my simple ignorance, suppose\verseline
		The self-same Power that brought me here brought you.\verseline
