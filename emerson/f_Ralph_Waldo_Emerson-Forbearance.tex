\begin{poem}
	\begin{stanza}
			Hast thou named all the birds without a gun?\verseline
			Loved the wood-rose, and left it on its stalk?\verseline
			At rich men's tables eaten bread and pulse?\verseline
			Unarmed, faced danger with a heart of trust?\verseline
			And loved so well a high behavior,\verseline
			In man or maid, that thou from speech refrained,\verseline
			Nobility more nobly to repay?\verseline
			O, be my friend, and teach me to be thine!
	\end{stanza}
