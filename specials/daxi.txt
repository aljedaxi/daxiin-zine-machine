         I STILL Remember 
my first teapot; how furious
 i was when it was broken
by my father — but he,how
furious he was   with me,
that he should be the one
   to have to break it. 

snowless December
settles  on The City     like
snow     on the desert
suffer not  The Sling of Cold
but    the dull crawl of deathless life

  Geist ist das Leben—
das aufhebt das Leben,und
    schneidt es.         was könnte
    man sagen  ,über das was
    man nicht sprechen kann?
              etwas          mystische.

   i         find myself
ever caked in     this ice-dry air. 
what was it to be              31
                      with
to feel the skin, to seek
        the soul  of another? 

Geist ist das Leben— [with translator's notes.]

Geist is The Life,  that
[ being   of life,  of
  being, differentiates,     ] 
  sublimates life,  and   cuts it.
[    cuts through, cuts over,
     cuts "the chase" itself.] 
     what can one   say,
[       such that one's saying lives
        in mind, in truth, in honor,] 
        about       the unspeakable?
[         thusly, we are cut.
          parsed by our cutting.
        & ]
          perhaps,  something mystical.

      snow still stalks spring's streets
       and chokes the air    with tinsel
we—side by side,breath
        by stride—  —dawdle down as mist
     dancing on currents by street light, 
  flitting like flames  through the dark.

soaked by the sun's blood and bile

  these airports are streams
   — and all the lonely people —
  can't step in themselves twice. 
 whence you walk? whither you came? 
each stepping cycling through the same. 

        these sugar-straight lines
             stymie-stiff the arteries,
           and cube-clot the core.
         how Gaudí grow the trees:    here
         all stone seems soft and smooth.


              Barcelona   comes
 in twos    maybe more        cities

     even this cup: ceramic
                    white save stains
                    eternally unfolds
                 25

 [quantum]states will keep collapsing
           even if you forget;
